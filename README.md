# Multi-class-Classification-with-Imbalanced-Data
Given a dataset with multiple classes where some classes have significantly fewer samples than others, implement a machine learning model that effectively handles
class imbalance. Use techniques such as data augmentation, oversampling, or cost-sensitive learning to improve the model's performance and evaluate it using 
appropriate metrics.
